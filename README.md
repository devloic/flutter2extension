# UPDATE August 12th, 2025

New version with wasm support for Flutter (Channel beta, 3.35.0-0.3.pre)
All made with AI, I don't know what is inside nor did I read the generated doc.

usage example (choose between shell script or node script):
```
./build-extension.js --output my-extension --wasm --content_scripts
./build-extension.js --output my-extension --web --popup
./build-extension.sh --output "my-extension-wasm-cs" --name "My App" --version "1.0.0" --content_scripts --wasm
```

Out of curiosity I decided to make claude code rewrite this old tool I made 2 years ago. 
Results are impressive. 2 weeks of work reduced to one day by claude code (with Max plan)
The "development" process becomes more like : prompt/test/give feedback. 80 % of the project
was accomplished in the first 2 hours. The last miles is were you still encounter the devil.
When hitting some tough problems there still is this feeling of "will claude make it or will i have
to use my brain for a second and dive in its code? Should i keep prompting as if it was a slot 
machine ?"  With gemini cli at least you knew when the bullshit cycle started so you could stop
iterating. But Claude gives you some good reasons and confidence to put another coin in the slot 
machine and try your chance again and you actually keep winning.
The "satisfying" moment was that it still got to the point were it was unable to solve an issue, 
so I told it to check my 2 years old repo and have a the look at the patched flutter files. 
Some minutes later, maybe "inspired" by something it didn't knew, it
improved its code and finally tackled the problem. It felt like team work an felt like I didn't waste
my time 2 years ago. 2 weeks of work now became some vectors that could still be useful 2 years
later, at least during 2 ms. It also felt that I was the AI's assistant 
instead of the other way round though. 
I lost a lot of time in regressions. Adding new functionality made old functionality break even
though I told it to be careful about regressions. It is a stupid recommendation, because errors are 
knowledge so errors for the AI is a way to improve, as for humans. Where I feel cheated is when
it repeats errors and does not detect errors it already fixed 3 hours before. I think that will
be resolved in the future but yeah for now it feels a little bit like "you don't mind I generate
some unnecessary token's again, I need to make a living". Commit a lot as soon as you  have 
something  stable and of course test at each iteration. At one moment I stopped testing regressions, 
instead of this I saved different versions of the script which each one working for a 
certain use case and later on I asked it to "merge" all these scripts in a single working script.
One has to be pragmatic at some point. Detecting regressions early could be a method though and I 
should have spent some time "automating" the testing but that meant creating a mcp server for 
"removing/installing an extension in a browser, activating it" , maybe take screenshots
and compare them with a screenshot of what is expected. I am sure that already exists though.

I am still learning how to be a good "copilot" for the AI. I can't imagine going back to the old
way of building. I almost stopped googling. I was not so confident at the early moments of AI, 
hallucinations created a lot of frustration. This time is gone though while it still happens from time
to time, but you can somehow "feel" the bluff of the AI. Actually that's when i start googling again.

Will the Ai become really creative, will we become dumber because of AI? I dont know if an AI could
reinvent relativity but it can help us reinventing it if we tell her that time is not such a constant
thing. Will we become dumber? I really thought so at a while ago but once you realize that you can
actually build things you never thought you could do it opens so many doors and you start learning
a lot doing things.  Did I just call her "her" ?


# OLD README starts here

# Features

- bundle several web enabled Flutter apps inside a browser extension, these apps get injected in webpages
- define where the app will be shown : inside a sidebar or a window ( winbox) for content scripts, in options or popup ( you can have an app appear in all presentation targets )

# Check the demo :  

[![Flutter2extension on Youtube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/OWs5GaYO2FM/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWs5GaYO2FM "Flutter2extension")

# Get started

- install npm ( https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm )
- clone flutter2extension : git clone https://github.com/devloic/flutter2extension
- edit config.json adding one or more apps
  ```
  {
    "projects":
        [{
            "git":"https://github.com/Roaa94/flutter_airbnb_ui",
            "pubspec_path": "",
            "target":["content_scripts","options","popup"],
            "presentation":["winbox"],
            "id":"flutter_airbnb_ui",
            "name":"flutter_airbnb_ui"
        }
        ]
    
}
```
set "git" if your source code is hosted on a git repository
set "pubspec_path" if the app is in a directory : /Users/lolo/development/flutter_project/my_flutter_app/pubspec.yaml
set "target" to specify where the app will show up , ex : ["content_scripts","popup"] if you want it to be injected in pages
via content scripts and show as a popup when you click on the extension's icon
set "presentation" ( only needed for  "content_scripts") : app will show in a "sidebar" or a "winbox" draggable window
set "id" to a unique id ( mandatory, could be the name of your repo)
set "name" : label of your app that will appear in tabs, winbox title...

if your Flutter app was not made for the web you can still try to add web support: flutter create --platforms web .  ( inside your flutter project)
you can check if the Flutter app works on chrome with: flutter run -d chrome  (inside your flutter project)

Once config.json is set:

cd grunt
npm install
grunt allin2

your can find the unpacked browser extension in : ./flutter_to_browser_extension/dist/unpacked
inside your chrome based browser go to extensions, set developer mode and click "Load unpacked" and select the flutter_to_browser_extension/dist/unpacked folder
refresh some webpage, the Flutter app should show up

flutter2extension is pretty stable but it will break many webpages (CSS collision) and some flutter apps might not work as expected (CORS), if that happens open a different webpage for testing. This will get fixed. Until flutter2extension gets more dynamic configuration settings don't consider it as a user-friendly tool. I am working on making it more suitable for every day user work. Consider it as an advanced proof of concept for now.






Package flutter apps in a browser extension (chrome)

While adding a flutter web enabled app to a chrome extension is a relatively easy [process](https://medium.com/flutter-community/building-a-chrome-extension-using-flutter-aeb100a6d6c) , the tutorials on the web only achieve including them as a popup view.

flutter2extension gives you the choice to package your flutter apps inside the extension's:  
- options  
- popup  
- content_scripts  

Why package apps in an extension?

Because it allows developers to easily distribute and showcase their apps with a ready-to-run app package. No hosting required.

As a developer how many times did you watch a tutorial about an app on youtube, click on the github repo link in the comments, clone the repo, add it to your IDE and then find out that it didn't build because packages were outdated, some configuration file were missing etc etc. We should be able to easily test an app without having to build it before. Embedding an app within content_scripts makes it possible for the app to inject code/content inside webpages. This opens a new level of functionalities and ... opportunities.

On the google webstore we have one app <=> one extension. flutter2extension can bundle multiple flutter apps inside one extension. While flutter2extension is in early stage, it was already able to run several flutter apps side by side in a same webpage. Your browser becomes a personal local application server you control.

# TODO Next
- isolate apps and webpages to avoid CSS collisions
- disable CORS when needed ( configurable)
- generate a settings page for each app so you can dynamically add API keys (this avoids having to set it in the source code)
- restrict apps to relevant pages in config.json
- persist and override settings in your own appwrite instance
- dynamically change app embedding : move app from sidebar to winbox and vice versa


# Future challenges:

- bypass the  google "webstore" with a custom package manager so you can install apps in your browser like you would install a module with npm, a linux app with apt
  => for now you can pull apps directly from git repos
- embed apps made with other frameworks: react, vue, etc ...
- speed app development through modular app design and interoperability between apps, think of apps as a service
- since injecting code and content might break pages and pages structure might change we need apps that can dynamically configure themselves with configurations rated and shared by the user community
- this project aims to create an ecosystem managed by an open source community which hopefully will generate the trust and transparency needed for user adoption
- focus on apps that offer crowdsourcing capabilities to engage collective intelligence instead of IA, let's prove that we can be faster and more accurate
